/// High-performance structured logging middleware for action processing.
///
/// `LoggingMiddleware` is the canonical example of a full-featured middleware implementation.
/// It demonstrates the complete middleware lifecycle: before action, after action, and error handling.
/// The middleware uses Swift's structured Logging framework to provide production-ready logging
/// with minimal performance overhead.
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - Structured logging with emoji markers for easy visual scanning
/// - Configurable log levels (debug, info, error)
/// - High-precision duration tracking in milliseconds
/// - Zero-cost when log level is insufficient
/// - Integration with system logging infrastructure
///
/// ## Architecture Role
/// LoggingMiddleware serves two purposes:
/// 1. **Development Tool**: Provides visibility into action flow during development
/// 2. **Reference Implementation**: Shows how to implement all three middleware protocols
///
/// ## Usage
/// Add logging to your feature's action handler:
/// ```swift
/// let handler = ActionHandler { action, state in
///   // Action handling logic
/// }
/// .use(LoggingMiddleware(
///   category: "MyFeature",
///   logLevel: .info  // Only log info and above
/// ))
/// ```
///
/// ## Log Output Format
/// The middleware produces structured logs with clear visual markers:
/// ```
/// 🎬 Action Started
/// Action: UserAction.login(credentials)
///
/// ✅ Action Completed
/// Action: UserAction.login(credentials)
/// Duration: 234.56ms
///
/// ❌ Action Failed
/// Action: UserAction.login(credentials)
/// Error: Network connection lost
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
/// - Log level checks happen before any string formatting
/// - Duration tracking uses high-precision ContinuousClock
/// - Structured logging minimizes allocation overhead
/// - Subsystem/category enable filtering in production
///
/// ## Production Usage
/// For production builds, configure appropriate log levels:
/// ```swift
/// #if DEBUG
/// let logLevel: Logger.Level = .debug
/// #else
/// let logLevel: Logger.Level = .error  // Only errors in production
/// #endif
///
/// handler.use(LoggingMiddleware(
///   category: "ProductionFeature",
///   logLevel: logLevel
/// ))
/// ```
///
/// ## Topics
/// ### Creating Middleware
/// - ``init(category:logLevel:)``
///
/// ### Middleware Protocol Conformance
/// - ``beforeAction(_:state:)``
/// - ``afterAction(_:state:result:duration:)``
/// - ``onError(_:action:state:)``
///
/// ### Properties
/// - ``id``

  ///
  /// The middleware automatically configures the subsystem from the app's bundle identifier
  /// and combines it with the category to create a hierarchical logging label.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - category: The logging category (default: "ViewFeature")
  ///   - logLevel: Minimum log level to emit (default: .debug)
  ///
  /// ## Example
  /// ```swift
  /// // Basic usage with defaults
  /// let logging = LoggingMiddleware()
  ///
  /// // Custom category for feature-specific logs
  /// let userLogging = LoggingMiddleware(
  ///   category: "UserManagement",
  ///   logLevel: .info
  /// )
  ///
  /// // Production configuration
  /// let prodLogging = LoggingMiddleware(
  ///   category: "ProductionApp",
  ///   logLevel: .error  // Only log errors
  /// )
  /// ```
