/// Manages and executes middleware in an action processing pipeline.
///
/// `MiddlewareManager` orchestrates the execution of middleware at different stages
/// of action processing: before actions, after actions, and during error handling.
/// It maintains a collection of middleware and executes them based on their protocol
/// conformance using the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).
///
/// ## Architecture Role
/// MiddlewareManager is used by ``ActionProcessor`` to execute the middleware pipeline:
/// - **Before Action**: Validates, logs, or prepares for action execution
/// - **After Action**: Records metrics, triggers analytics, or performs cleanup
/// - **Error Handling**: Logs errors, reports to services, or performs recovery
///
/// ## Key Features
/// - Protocol-based middleware execution (ISP compliance)
/// - Order-preserving execution
/// - Error resilience (one middleware failure doesn't stop others)
/// - Dynamic middleware registration
/// - Type-safe middleware management
///
/// ## Usage
/// MiddlewareManager is typically used internally by ``ActionProcessor``:
/// ```swift
/// let manager = MiddlewareManager<MyAction, MyState>()
/// manager.addMiddleware(LoggingMiddleware())
/// manager.addMiddleware(AnalyticsMiddleware())
///
/// // Execute before action
/// try await manager.executeBeforeAction(action: .login, state: currentState)
///
/// // Execute after action with duration
/// try await manager.executeAfterAction(
///   action: .login,
///   state: newState,
///   result: task,
///   duration: 0.123
/// )
///
/// // Execute error handling
/// await manager.executeErrorHandling(
///   error: someError,
///   action: .login,
///   state: currentState
/// )
/// ```
///
/// ## Middleware Execution Order
/// Middleware executes in the order it's added:
/// ```swift
/// manager.addMiddleware(middleware1)  // Executes first
/// manager.addMiddleware(middleware2)  // Executes second
/// manager.addMiddleware(middleware3)  // Executes third
/// ```
///
/// ## Protocol-Based Execution
/// Only middleware conforming to the appropriate protocol executes at each stage:
/// - ``BeforeActionMiddleware``: Only runs during `executeBeforeAction`
/// - ``AfterActionMiddleware``: Only runs during `executeAfterAction`
/// - ``ErrorHandlingMiddleware``: Only runs during `executeErrorHandling`
/// - ``ActionMiddleware``: Runs during all three stages (composite protocol)
///
/// ## Error Resilience
/// If a middleware throws an error during error handling:
/// - The error is logged but not propagated
/// - Remaining error middleware still executes
/// - This prevents error handling from failing catastrophically
///
/// ## Topics
/// ### Creating a Manager
/// - ``init(middlewares:)``
///
/// ### Managing Middleware
/// - ``addMiddleware(_:)``
/// - ``addMiddlewares(_:)``
/// - ``allMiddlewares``
///
/// ### Executing Middleware
/// - ``executeBeforeAction(action:state:)``
/// - ``executeAfterAction(action:state:result:duration:)``
/// - ``executeErrorHandling(error:action:state:)``

  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - error: The error that occurred

  ///   error: networkError,
  ///   action: .fetchData,
  ///   state: currentState
  /// )

  ///
  /// ## Use Cases
  /// - Log errors with context
  /// - Report to error tracking services (Sentry, Bugsnag)
  /// - Send error analytics
  /// - Trigger error recovery actions
  /// - Display error notifications
  ///
  /// ## Error Resilience

  /// ```
  /// ðŸš¨ Middleware 'MyMiddleware' failed during error handling: <error description>
